# The dataset file concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values had been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. We need to find the outliers in the dataset i.e finding the customers who has cheated while the credit approval. First column corresponds to the customer ID, while the last column says whether the customer got the approval or not. We use Unsupervised Learning approach to detect the outliers.
